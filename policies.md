title: Globus @ Stanford Policies

As is the case with many cloud services, one name (in this case, Globus) can
refer to many products.  This page spells out exactly what is available, who
can use it, and under what conditions.

The following Globus services are available for free from Globus, without a
subscription:

* [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal)

* [Globus Connect Server](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server) (not
  managed)

Stanford's Globus subscription covers the following services:

* [Globus Plus](https://www.globus.org/researchers/plus-plans)

* [Globus Connect Server](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server),
  managed (includes the management console and usage reports)

* [Globus Publish](https://www.globus.org/data-sharing)

There are no limits on the number of endpoints, the number of files
transferred, or amount of data transferred.

Finally, there are a few additional conditions:

* Only Low Risk data may be shared using Globus.

  The Information Security Office has not evaluated Globus for handling data
  rated as Medium or High Risk.  As always, it is up to the data owners to
  determine the [Risk Classification](http://dataclass.stanford.edu/) for their
  data.

* Globus Plus is only available to people who have a full-service (or full
  sponsored) SUNetID.

  If you have a Stanford email address, you can use Globus Plus!  If you do
  not have a Stanford email address, ask your contact about getting a
  [sponsored account](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sponsorship/sponsoredservices).

* Support is provided by Stanford first.

  If you have problems, please [contact us]({{ "support.html" | absolute_url
  }}) first.  We will do the initial information-gathering; and if we are
  unable to help you, we will escalate the issue to Globus.

* A few groups are not covered by our subscription.

  Our Globus subscription covers everyone who reports up to the President.  The
  complete list is best represented by the charts contained in Admin Guide
  Chapter 9.

  This means some entities are not covered; also, one entity is explicitly
  excluded from the above list:

  * Stanford Health Care.

  * Stanford Children's Health.

  * The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

  SLAC's exclusion is because, even though the SLAC Director and Vice President
  do report to the President and/or Provost, Stanford operates SLAC on behalf
  of the Department of Energy.

  If you are a member of one of the above groups, we suggest leveraging any
  relationships you have with one of the Seven Schools.  Should that fail, a
  separate subscription would need to be negotiated.

* Premium Storage Connectors are not included in the subscription.

  Globus is able to manage data stored on a number of non-POSIX filesystems,
  including: Amazon S3, Box, Ceph RADOS, [Google
  Drive](https://www.globus.org/connectors/google-drive), HDFS, [HGST
  ActiveScale](https://www.globus.org/connectors/activescale), and Spectra
  Logic BlackPearl.  However, our subscription does not cover these connectors.

  We are looking for groups interested in helping cover the cost of these
  connectors, particularly for Amazon S3 and Google Drive.  If your group is
  interested, please [reach out]({{ "support.html" | absolute_url }})!

* Our subscription expires on May 16, 2020.

  Continued funding by the University will depend on us demonstrating use of,
  and continued need for, the service.  So, please [keep in touch]({{
  "support.html" | absolute_url }}).
