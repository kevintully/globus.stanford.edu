As a first-time user, it is worth knowing a little bit about how Globus handles identities and authentication.  Globus recognizes that many people have multiple accounts, not just the account at their primary institution.  For example, if you do work at CERN, then you may have a CERN account.  Globus calls each of these identities.  The first time you log in to Globus, the account you use to log in will be your primary identity; once logged in, you can add linked identities, one for each account at other institutions.

In the example above, Karl (who works at Stanford) first logged into Globus using his Stanford credentials, but later he added his OSU account, and his personal email address, as linked identities.  Karl was able to add his personal email address because he has a Google account linked to it.

Karl can now log in to Globus using any of his identities.  If someone wants to share something with Karl, or add him to a group, they can do so using any of his email addresses.

Got an XSEDE Allocation?
If you have access to any XSEDE resources, you should link your XSEDE account.  All XSEDE clusters (including XStream) use your XSEDE account for authentication.

Google, ORCID, United ID
If you have an account with one of these services—even if you registered with your personal email address—you can link them!

For entities without any institutional affiliation, you can get a Globus ID account.  It is mainly used for entities (like programs) do not have a normal institutional account.  It is also the last-resort option if you want to link a personal email address.

## Logging In

Begin by going to https://www.globus.org/app.  You will be taken to the login page, and asked to select an institution.  Choose Stanford University.
